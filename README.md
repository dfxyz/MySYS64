# MySYS64

## Setup
Basic steps:
1. Extract 'msys64' here (the same directory of 'README.md');
2. Run 'terminal.exe' and execute 'setup.sh';
3. Restart 'terminal.exe';
4. Done!

If any core package like 'filesystem' or 'pacman' is upgraded,
'setup.sh' is required to execute again.

Optional:
* Execute 'context_menu_items.cmd' as administartors to add or remove 
MySYS64's context menu items
